    "Ans) An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some value. If there is more than one operator in an expression, their precedence decides which operation will be performed first. All expressions do some kind of mathematical or logical computation or comparison. The different types of expression are:\n",
    "1. Constant expression - Expression that have constant value only\n",
    "2. Arithmetic expression - It can be combination of numeric values, operators and sometimes parenthesis\n",
    "3. Integral expression - they produce only integer results after all computations and type conversions\n",
    "4. Floating expression - these are expressions which produce floating point numbers as a result of all computations and conversions\n",
    "5. Relational expression - In these cases arithmatic expressions are written on both sides of relational operators\n",
    "6. Logical expression - These are expressions that result in either True or false\n",
    "7. Bitwise expression - these are expressions where the computations are performed at bit level\n",
    "8. Combinational expression - It can be a mix of multiple expressions in a single expression"
